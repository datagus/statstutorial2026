####----2. Correlation with small sample ----####

# Correlation example from video "How to calculate Pearson's correlation by hand"
# defining / loading your data
Student_attitude <- c(94,73,59,80,93,85,66,79,77,91)
correct_answers <- c(17,13,12,15,16,14,16,16,18,19)

# Testing for normality
shapiro.test(Student_attitude) # p-value above 0.05 -> normal distribution, ! but small sample! 
shapiro.test(correct_answers)

hist(Student_attitude)
hist(correct_answers)
plot(Student_attitude,correct_answers) # does this look like a correlation?

# Pearson's correlation coefficient
cor(Student_attitude,correct_answers)
#Correlation test statistic
cor.test(Student_attitude,correct_answers)

####----3. Correlation with survey data ----####

#load survey data 
trivial<-read.csv("survey26cleaned.csv",header=T, sep=",")

# inspect data and attach

# use correlation test on siblings number and pets

# check with histogram if the variables are normally distributed

#look at summary
summary(siblings_number)
summary(pets)

# can we use the logarithm for a transformation of pets and siblings_number?
log(0) #what is the logarithm of zero?

hist(log(siblings_number+1)) # avoiding -Inf
hist(log(pets+1))           # avoiding -Inf
shapiro.test(log(siblings_number+1)) 
shapiro.test(log(pets+1)) 
# Without a normal distribution, we cannot use Pearson correlation
# Alternative: let's try other types of correlations instead
?cor.test
# try spearman and kendall, both do not require normally distributed data

# what is the difference between those two methods?

#visualize
plot(siblings_number,pets)
table(siblings_number,pets)

#find other variables in the survey data (trivial data) suitable for a correlation


####----4. Correlation with Automobile data ----####
#load data
auto<-read.table("Automobile_R.txt",header=T)
attach(auto)
str(auto)
summary(auto)
#this shows the correlation coefficients for the entire data set (only possible if your data set contains only numbers)
cor(auto)
cor(auto,use = "complete.obs")
plot(auto)
#let's correlate automobile width with length

#how does this look like?
plot(width,length)
#are the two continuous variables normally distributed?

# try data transformation with logarithm

#if the data is not normally distributed there are two non-parametric rank correlations to choose from


# correlation between wheel base (= horizontal distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels) and length
hist(wheel.base)
hist(length)
cor.test(wheel.base,length)
#find a continuous variable in this data set that is normally distributed based on the Shapiro test


####----5. Correlation with base r datasets ----####

# cars dataset
str(cars) # !! different than mtcars dataset
plot(cars) # what is your assumption about a potential correlation?

# create histograms

# run correlation

# mtcars dataset
cor(mtcars)
min(cor(mtcars)) # find "the most" negative correlation coefficient

# create histograms for vs and mpg

# run correlation for vs and mpg, !! works?

# create histograms for horse power

# run correlation for hp and mpg, pearson, spearman or kendall?

# run correlation for wt and mpg, pearson, spearman or kendall?
