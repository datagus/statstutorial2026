# this data set is growth of caterpillars [mg] in relation to tannin concentration [micromole] in their diet

# let's take an initial look at the data

## check normal distribution of variables

# histogram of growth

# shapiro test of growth

# histogram of tannin

# shapiro test of tannin

## linear regression model with abline

#you can also write

# let's look at the residuals of the model

####----4. Multiple Linear Regression with AirBNB data ----####

# are the residuals of the model normally distributed?


# can we improve the distribution of the residuals by transforming some of our variables?

# next attempt

## Checking for multicollinearity

#only choose independent variables that do not correlate with each other

#does the model perform better with metro_dist instead of distance?

## Let's take a closer look at London

# select London for multiple regression
London <- air[city == 'London',]

detach(air)

# data inspection
dim(London)
summary(London)

# multiple regression with price as dependent and three characteristics as independent variables
london_mod1<- lm(log(price)~cleanliness+bedrooms+distance)

# multiple regression with guest satisfaction as dependent and four characteristics as independent variables

# compare London with other cities

#now try multiple regression with other cities....
