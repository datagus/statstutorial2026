# Load the data
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------####

# Run these lines to load necessary packages and data:

# Set your working directory for this session
setwd("/Users/jule/Desktop/R/Tutorium 2026/Day 13 Recap")

# Load the data 
cereal <- read.csv("cereal_format.csv", sep = ",") 
  
# Transform a variable to the right data format
cereal$shelf <- as.factor(cereal$shelf)

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------####
# Overview, descriptive Statistics, and basic plots
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------####

# Attach the data

# Take a look at the whole data set


# Call the first 5 rows in the data set


# Look at the structure of the data set


# Look at the summary of the data set


# Plot a histogram of the sodium amount in all cereal brands


# Plot a box plot of the sugar amount in all cereal brands

  
# Plot 2 box plots of potassium and sodium amount in one plot


# Plot box plots of sugars amount among different manufacturers


# Plot a scatter plot of sugars and ratings for all cereal brands


#---------------------------------------------------------------------------####
# Chi-Squared test
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------####

# Test whether cereal brand from a specific manufacturer would affect its placing on
# the shelf

# Print out contingency table

# Conduct chi-squared test

  

# Can you draw a conclusion?

# Exclude manufacturer A and R and perform chisq.test on reduced data

# Correlation Matrix - Visualization
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------####

# This time we are working with the object cerealNutri. It should only contain the 
# nutrient contents of the cereal brands, weight, cups and the ratings.
# Try to create this dataframe based on the object "cereal"
# Backup plan, load new data

# Create subset without "name, mfr, type, shelf".
# There are multiple ways of doing this.


  
# Or  load the data if you did not succeed
cerealNutri <- read.csv("cereal_num.csv", sep = ",") 

# We have a lot of continuous variables in the data. It's worthwhile to have a 
# look at the correlation matrix to see the relationships among them:


  
# Here you can try and visualize a correlation matrix for a better overview.
# You can install the package corrplot using the following command 
install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot::corrplot(cor(cerealNutri), addCoef.col = "black", type = "upper", number.cex = 0.5)

# Some correlations are pretty strong. Let's confirm them with a correlation test.
# Correlation test between the sugar portion and the rating:


# Correlation test between the fiber portion and the rating:



# Do you meet the preconditions for the tests?



# Use a different correlation method


# Spearman correlation


# Can you draw a conclusion?

# ANOVA & Post-Hoc
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------####

# New data set "growth" Crawley (2007) The R book.Imperial College London at Silwood Park, UK
# A factorial experiment has two or more factors, each with two or more levels, 
# plus replication for each combination of factors levels. 
# Our example comes from a farm-scale trial of animal diets. 
# There are two factors: diet and supplement. 
# Diet is a factor with three levels: barley, oats and wheat. 
# Supplement is a factor with four levels: agrimore, control, supergain and supersupp. 
# The response variable is weight gain after 6 weeks.

# Load the data

# Inspect the data

# Transform supplement and diet into factors

# Attach the data

# Visualise gain by diet and supplement

# There seems to be difference in gain by supplement and
# diet, confirm this with an ANOVA test:


# Let's look at the summary output of the test:


# Simplify the model if necessary


# Did you meet the preconditions of the test?


# It is significant. So we can call for a post-hoc test:


# Can you draw a conclusion?
# Which diet and which supplement would you recommend to the farmer?
# Look at the boxplot. Which has the highest gain?
# Is it significantly different from the lower gain?
